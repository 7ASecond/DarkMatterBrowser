# Dark Matter Browser

The Dark Matter Browser is being developed to allow people to use the internet without fear of persecution from hostile governments, government agencies and individuals.

Based upon the Chrome Rendering Engine, it will allow access to HTTP/S, TOR, and in time other protocols all forced through a preconfigured VPN.

All the settings, history, cookies, caches etc are saved using the LOS Distributed Encrypted File System. Making it impossible for outside parties to know if you have ever used the browser and if you have where you went and what you did whilst using the browser.
